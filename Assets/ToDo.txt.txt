story
as was foretold
so it has come to pass
the promise has been fulfilled
that which was hidden shall be revealed

there are stories older than time itself
some times the old ones say

there are stories the old ones sometimes tell
stories that are older than time iteself

that the world we know is but a shattered remnant of what once was
the world was once whole
people could walk great distances across vast unbroken tracts of land
ships sailed through the skys, though not as they do now
and also across unimaginably huge bodies of water, between great stretches of land larger than you could see across.
